Hi there, this is a lavina go package, that we develop for ourselves. 
For now there is only a response struct and Response func that initialize it. It is used for organization our json responses from servers.
Caution readme may not be up to date. (if someone wants he can make some formatting on this file)

for instal first u need to set GOPRIVATE to github.com/Lavina-Tech-LLC (see go help env), then use 

go get github.com/Lavina-Tech-LLC/lavinagopackage
